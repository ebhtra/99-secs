# 99-secs
A simple and enjoyable game

This game was built as a means of trying out various UITextField Delegate methods and their ability to control the flow of a simple word game.  

The game player has 99 seconds to score as many points as possible, trying to find what the missing letters are.  More points are awarded
for letters deeper in the alphabet, since it is easier for people to find the answer by reciting abc's in their heads. Points are deducted for wrong guesses.
The puzzle is hidden when the game is in the background, to avoid cheating.  

The top ten scores are stored on Parse.com and are retrieved at various times during play of the game so that the app can display the leaderboard and allow the user to enter her name and score should she score high enough.
